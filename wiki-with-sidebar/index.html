                <h1>Orion</h1>
                <p>
                    Orion is a prominent set of stars visible during winter
                     in the northern celestial hemisphere. It is one of the 
                     88 modern constellations; it was among the 48 
                     constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer 
                     Ptolemy. It is named for a hunter in Greek mythology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Orion is most prominent during winter evenings in the 
                    Northern Hemisphere, as are five other constellations 
                    that have stars in the Winter Hexagon asterism. Orion’s 
                    two brightest stars, Rigel (β) and Betelgeuse (α), are 
                    both among the brightest stars in the night sky; both 
                    are supergiants and slightly variable. There are a 
                    further six stars brighter than magnitude 3.0, including 
                    three making the short straight line of the Orion’s Belt 
                    asterism. Orion also hosts the Orionids, the strongest 
                    meteor shower associated with Halley’s Comet, and the 
                    Orion Nebula, one of the brightest nebulae in the sky.

                <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Orion is bordered by Taurus to the northwest, Eridanus 
                    to the southwest, Lepus to the south, Monoceros to the 
                    east, and Gemini to the northeast. Covering 594 square 
                    degrees, Orion ranks twenty-sixth of the 88 constellations 
                    in size. The constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian 
                    astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a 
                    polygon of 26 sides. In the equatorial coordinate system, 
                    the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie 
                    between 04h 43.3m and 06h 25.5m , while the declination 
                    coordinates are between 22.87° and −10.97°. The 
                    constellation’s three-letter abbreviation, as adopted 
                    by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, 
                    is “Ori”.[2]

                <p>
                    Orion is most visible in the evening sky from January to 
                    April,[3] winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and summer 
                    in the Southern Hemisphere. In the tropics (less than 
                    about 8° from the equator), the constellation transits 
                    at the zenith. <br>In the period May–July (summer in the 
                    Northern Hemisphere, winter in the Southern Hemisphere), 
                    Orion is in the daytime sky and thus invisible at most 
                    latitudes. However, for much of Antarctica in the Southern 
                    Hemisphere’s winter months, the Sun is below the horizon 
                    even at midday. Stars (and thus Orion, but only the 
                    brightest stars) are then visible at twilight for a 
                    few hours around local noon, just in the brightest 
                    section of the sky low in the North where the Sun is 
                    just below the horizon. At the same time of day at the 
                    South Pole itself (Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station), 
                    Rigel is only 8° above the horizon, and the Belt sweeps 
                    just along it. In the Southern Hemisphere’s summer months, 
                    when Orion is normally visible in the night sky, the 
                    constellation is actually not visible in Antarctica 
                    because the sun does not set at that time of year south 
                    of the Antarctic Circle.[4][5]
