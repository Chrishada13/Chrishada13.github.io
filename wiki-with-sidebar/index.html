                <p>
                    Orion is a prominent set of stars visible during winter
                     in the northern celestial hemisphere. It is one of the 
                     88 modern constellations; it was among the 48 
                     constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer 
                     Ptolemy. It is named for a hunter in Greek mythology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Orion is most prominent during winter evenings in the 
                    Northern Hemisphere, as are five other constellations 
                    that have stars in the Winter Hexagon asterism. Orion’s 
                    two brightest stars, Rigel (β) and Betelgeuse (α), are 
                    both among the brightest stars in the night sky; both 
                    are supergiants and slightly variable. There are a 
                    further six stars brighter than magnitude 3.0, including 
                    three making the short straight line of the Orion’s Belt 
                    asterism. Orion also hosts the Orionids, the strongest 
                    meteor shower associated with Halley’s Comet, and the 
                    Orion Nebula, one of the brightest nebulae in the sky.

                    Orion is bordered by Taurus to the northwest, Eridanus 
                    to the southwest, Lepus to the south, Monoceros to the 
                    east, and Gemini to the northeast. Covering 594 square 
                    degrees, Orion ranks twenty-sixth of the 88 constellations 
                    in size. The constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian 
                    astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a 
                    polygon of 26 sides. In the equatorial coordinate system, 
                    the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie 
                    between 04h 43.3m and 06h 25.5m , while the declination 
                    coordinates are between 22.87° and −10.97°. The 
                    constellation’s three-letter abbreviation, as adopted 
                    by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, 
                    is “Ori”.[2]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Orion is most visible in the evening sky from January to 
                    April,[3] winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and summer 
                    in the Southern Hemisphere. In the tropics (less than 
                    about 8° from the equator), the constellation transits 
                    at the zenith. <br>In the period May–July (summer in the 
                    Northern Hemisphere, winter in the Southern Hemisphere), 
                    Orion is in the daytime sky and thus invisible at most 
                    latitudes. However, for much of Antarctica in the Southern 
                    Hemisphere’s winter months, the Sun is below the horizon 
                    even at midday. Stars (and thus Orion, but only the 
                    brightest stars) are then visible at twilight for a 
                    few hours around local noon, just in the brightest 
                    section of the sky low in the North where the Sun is 
                    just below the horizon. At the same time of day at the 
                    South Pole itself (Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station), 
                    Rigel is only 8° above the horizon, and the Belt sweeps 
                    just along it. In the Southern Hemisphere’s summer months, 
                    when Orion is normally visible in the night sky, the 
                    constellation is actually not visible in Antarctica 
                    because the sun does not set at that time of year south 
                    of the Antarctic Circle.[4][5]

                    Orion is very useful as an aid to locating other stars. 
                    By extending the line of the Belt southeastward, Sirius 
                    (α CMa) can be found; northwestward, Aldebaran (α Tau). 
                    A line eastward across the two shoulders indicates 
                    the direction of Procyon (α CMi). A line from Rigel 
                    through Betelgeuse points to Castor and Pollux (α Gem 
                    and β Gem). Additionally, Rigel is part of the Winter 
                    Circle asterism. Sirius and Procyon, which may be located 
                    from Orion by following imaginary lines (see map), also 
                    are points in both the Winter Triangle and the Circle.

                    Orion’s seven brightest stars form a distinctive 
                    hourglass-shaped asterism, or pattern, in the night 
                    sky. Four stars—Rigel, Betelgeuse, Bellatrix, and 
                    Saiph—form a large roughly rectangular shape, at 
                    the center of which lies the three stars of Orion’s 
                    Belt—Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka. His head is marked 
                    by an additional 8th star called Meissa, which is fairly 
                    bright to the observer. Descending from the “belt” is 
                    a smaller line of three stars, Orion’s Sword 
                    (the middle of which is in fact not a star but the Orion 
                    Nebula), also known as the hunter’s sword.<br>Many of 
                    the stars are luminous hot blue supergiants, with 
                    the stars of the belt and sword forming the Orion OB1 
                    association. Standing out by its red hue, Betelgeuse 
                    may nevertheless be a runaway member of the same group.

                        <b>Betelgeuse</b>, also designated Alpha Orionis, 
                        is a massive M-type red supergiant star nearing 
                        he end of its life. It is the second brightest 
                        star in Orion, and is a semiregular variable star.
                        \[7] It serves as the “right shoulder” of the hunter 
                        (assuming that he is facing the observer). It is 
                        generally the eleventh brightest star in the night 
                        sky, but this has varied between being the tenth 
                        brightest to the 23rd brightest by the end of 2019.
                        [8][9] The end of its life is expected to result in 
                        a supernova explosion that will be highly visible from 
                        Earth, possibly outshining the Earth’s moon and being 
                        visible during the day. This is most likely to occur 
                        within the next 100,000 years.[10]

                        blue supergiant that is the sixth brightest star in 
                        the night sky. Similar to Betelgeuse, Rigel is fusing 
                        heavy elements in its core and will pass its supergiant 
                        stage soon (on an astronomical timescale), either 
                        collapsing in the case of a supernova or shedding 
                        its outer layers and turning into a white dwarf. It 
                        serves as the left foot of the hunter.[11]

                        <b>Bellatrix</b> is designated Gamma Orionis by Johann 
                        Bayer. It is the twenty-seventh brightest star in the 
                        night sky. Bellatrix is considered a B-type blue giant, 
                        though it is too small to explode in a supernova. 
                        Bellatrix’s luminosity is derived from its high 
                        temperature rather than a large radius.[12] 
                        Bellatrix marks Orion’s left shoulder and it means the 
                        “female warrior”, and is sometimes known colloquially 
                        as the “Amazon Star”.[13] It is the closest major 
                        star in Orion at only 244.6 light years from our 
                        solar system.

                        <b>Mintaka</b> is designated Delta Orionis, despite 
                        being the faintest of the three stars in Orion’s 
                        Belt. Its name means “the belt”. It is a multiple 
                        star system, composed of a large B-type blue giant 
                        and a more massive O-type main-sequence star. The 
                        Mintaka system constitutes an eclipsing binary variable 
                        star, where the eclipse of one star over the other 
                        creates a dip in brightness. Mintaka is the westernmost 
                        of the three stars of Orion’s Belt, as well as the 
                        northernmost.[6]

                        [6] It is the middle and brightest of the three stars 
                        of Orion’s Belt. Alnilam is a B-type blue supergiant; 
                        despite being nearly twice as far from the Sun as the 
                        other two belt stars, its luminosity makes it nearly 
                        equal in magnitude. Alnilam is losing mass quickly, a 
                        consequence of its size. It is the farthest major star 
                        in Orion at 1,344 light years.

                        Belt. It is a triple star system, with the primary 
                        star being a hot blue supergiant and the brightest

                    and on the star map the figure of the Rooster is 
                    located below and behind the figure of the True 
                    Shepherd—both constellations represent the herald 
                    of the gods, in his bird and human forms respectively.[23]

                    The Seri people of northwestern Mexico call the three 
                    stars in the belt of Orion Hapj (a name denoting a hunter) 
                    which consists of three stars: Hap (mule deer), Haamoja 
                    (pronghorn), and Mojet (bighorn sheep). Hap is in the 
                    middle and has been shot by the hunter; its blood has 
                    dripped onto Tiburón Island.[44]<br>The same three stars 
                    are known in Spain and most of Latin America as “Las 
                    tres Marías” (Spanish for “The Three Marys“). In Puerto 
                    Rico, the three stars are known as the “Los Tres Reyes 
                    Magos” (Spanish for The three Wise Men).[45]<br>The Ojibwa 
                    (Chippewa) Native Americans call this constellation 
                    Kabibona’kan, the Winter Maker, as its presence in the 
                    night sky heralds winter.[citation needed]<br>To the Lakota 
                    Native Americans, Tayamnicankhu (Orion’s Belt) is the 
                    spine of a bison. The great rectangle of Orion is the 
                    bison’s ribs; the Pleiades star cluster in nearby Taurus 
                    is the bison’s head; and Sirius in Canis Major, known as 
                    Tayamnisinte, is its tail. Another Lakota myth mentions 
                    that the bottom half of Orion, the Constellation of the 
                    Hand, represented the arm of a chief that was ripped off 
                    by the Thunder People as a punishment from the gods for 
                    his selfishness. His daughter offered to marry the person 
                    who can retrieve his arm from the sky, so the young warrior 
                    Fallen Star (whose father was a star and whose mother was 
                    human) returned his arm and married his daughter, 
                    symbolizing harmony between the gods and humanity with 
                    the help of the younger generation. The index finger is 
                    represented by Rigel; the Orion Nebula is the thumb; the 
                    Belt of Orion is the wrist; and the star Beta Eridani is 
                    the pinky finger.
