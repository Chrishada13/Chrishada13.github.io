            Pegasus is a prominent constellation in the northern sky, named 
            after a winged horse in Greek mythology. The constellation is one 
            of the older ones known in the night sky: It is one of the 48 
            constellations listed by the second-century astronomer Ptolemy. 
            Today, Pegasus is one of the 88 constellations officially recognized 
            by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).<br>In the Northern 
            Hemisphere, the constellation is high in the sky starting near the 
            end of summer and continuing through autumn. If you are below the 
            equator, look for Pegasus in late winter and through spring.<br>The 
            constellation is famous for hosting the first exoplanet ever found 
            around a normal star, as well as a galaxy known as M15.

            The Andromeda constellation consists of 16 stars visible in 
            the northern sky. Named by ancient Greeks after the mythological 
            Andromeda princess, the constellation contains the Andromeda 
            Galaxy, the nearest full-fledged galaxy to our own Milky Way.

            In ancient Greek mythology, Andromeda was a beautiful daughter of 
            the king Cepheus and queen Cassiopeia. When her mother bragged that 
            Andromeda was better-looking than the famously beautiful Nereid sea 
            nymphs, the sea god Poseidon sent his pet sea monster Cetus to 
            destroy Cepheus' kingdom.<br>It was said, however, that sacrificing 
            Andromeda could save the country and its people. So, the loving 
            parents had their daughter chained to a rock by the sea, so that 
            the sea monster could get her easily. Fortunately, the charming 
            prince Perseus flew past on his winged horse Pegasus and fell in 
            love with Andromeda's beauty. He killed Cetus and married Andromeda. 
            The two lived happily ever after.

            Perseus is the 24th largest constellation in the night sky and is 
            visible across the Northern Hemisphere and parts of the Southern 
            Hemisphere.

            Perseus is best known as the radiant of August's Perseid meteor 
            shower, one of the most prolific meteor showers of the year, as 
            well as the variable star Algol, also known as the Demon Star. 
            Algol fluctuates in brightness, appearing to "wink" in the night 
            sky — this occurs when its two binary components eclipse 
            one another.

            Perseus was a Greek hero, a demigod born of Zeus and Danae. 
            According to GreekMythology.com, Perseus was tasked by the Greek 
            king Polydectes to fetch the head of Medusa, the only mortal Gorgon. 
            The gorgons were a trio of sisters with snakes for hair, whose gaze 
            turned men to stone. Polydectes gave Perseus this task with the hope 
            it would kill him, allowing Polydectes to forcibly marry Danae, 
            who had rejected his advances.
            <br>The legend has many tie-ins to Perseus' neighboring 
            constellations Andromeda, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, Cetus and Pegasus. 
            On his journey home after slaying Medusa, Perseus saved Andromeda, 
            the daughter of Cassiopeia and Cephus, from being sacrificed to the 
            sea monster Cetus. He later married Andromeda, and the two 
            constellations named for the pair are next to each other in the 
            sky. Perseus is also involved with the origin story of Pegasus, 
            the winged horse — Pegasus emerged from Medusa's body after Perseus 
            beheaded her.
