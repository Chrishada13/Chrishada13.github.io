                    Lies of P is set in the late 19th Century to the early 
                    20th Century of the Belle Époque Era in Europe within 
                    a city called Krat. The city of Krat was once a beautiful 
                    place but has now become lost and turned into a living 
                    hell that is filled with unspeakable horrors due to a 
                    deadly plague. Krat is featured as a grim city where 
                    multiple automatons now roam almost every part of the 
                    center, from the streets, rooftops, alleyways, and within 
                    buildings. As you start your adventure in Lies of P, you 
                    play as the puppet mechanoid Pinocchio who awakens in an 
                    abandoned train station not knowing where he has come 
                    from and what his purpose is. As we all know the famous 
                    fable of Pinocchio, Mr. Geppetto carved a wooden puppet 
                    named Pinocchio and was visited by the Blue Fairy who 
                    granted Mr. Geppetto's wish by transforming the puppet 
                    into a living being, that being said, Pinocchio sets 
                    forth into reaching his goal of becoming a real boy.

                    Lies of P, a new action Souls-like inspired game was 
                    officially announced with a trailer back in May 2021. 
                    It highlighted a cinematic trailer featuring Mr. Geppetto, 
                    the creator of the famous puppet, Pinocchio, as well as a 
                    sneak peek of the new style of the now puppet mechanoid, 
                    Pinocchio. Lies of P Game Developer and Publisher NEOWIZ 
                    Games, alongside Game Developer Round8 Studio, highlighted 
                    a unique feature called the "Lie" System where what players 
                    do and choose to say as Pinocchio will dynamically affect 
                    various points of gameplay.

                    And in August 2021, Lies of P officially launched their 
                    Twitter account and celebrated it with fans of the game 
                    by hosting a Welcoming Event — it was in the same month 
                    where Lies of P rolled out its official page, 
                    https://liesofp.com.

                    The story of Lies of P is inspired by the Italian writer, 
                    Carlo Collodi's work called The Adventures of Pinocchio, 
                    commonly known as just Pinocchio. The story is about an 
                    impoverished elderly woodcarver by the name of Mister 
                    Geppetto who is also the creator of Pinocchio.

                    In the book, Geppetto visits a carpenter called Antonio 
                    to ask for scrap wood for a marionette that he's working 
                    on. Antonio happens to be working on a wooden leg for a 
                    table but is having trouble with a wooden block. Antonio 
                    tells Geppetto that he stumbled upon a talking wooden 
                    block and decided to give it to him out of fear.

                    Mister Geppetto happily brings home the extra piece of 
                    wood and decides to make a puppet out of it and earn money 
                    from it. In the process of carving the puppet, which we 
                    will come to know as Pinocchio, it manages to kick Geppetto 
                    and shows early signs of mischievousness. The moment 
                    Mister Geppetto finishes his work, the first thing 
                    he does is teach Pinocchio how to walk. Then, the puppet 
                    runs away and into the town, leaving his creator behind.

                    The director of Lies of P confirmed that a new sequel is 
                    being developed and their team is working hard on exploring 
                    the many aspects of this new project. Their priority is 
                    to work on the upcoming patch this November (the exact 
                    dates are still being discussed as of posting) where 
                    balances are expected especially in the Weapon Assembly 
                    System, and additional wearables that will grant players 
                    wider control on choosing their Costumes.
